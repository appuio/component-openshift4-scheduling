= OpenShift4 Scheduling: A Commodore component to manage OpenShift4 cluster schedulers

{doctitle} is a Commodore component for Managing https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-about.html[OpenShift4 cluster schedulers].

== Default Node Selector

This components assumes dedicated infra nodes are used.
The component further assumes the existence of an _app_ node role.
This is required to prevent regular workload from being scheduled on those infra nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the target cluster does have nodes with the _app_ role label set.
See the components defaults for the exact value.
